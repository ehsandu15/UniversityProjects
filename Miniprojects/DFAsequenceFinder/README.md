## Automata DFA Sequence Detection  
# How to setup  
You must follow the following format(you can find an example in automata.txt):  
1- First line isn't important(you can type anything).  
2- Second line you must write all the symbols in full (0, 1, 2, ..., 9) seprated by a space.  
3- The other lines is as follows: q[0-9 +f]| the next state for each symbol separated by a space.  
# How to use  
just type the symbols for a sequence and if a sequence exists it'll give you the path it followed to find the sequence.  
To start the program just type ./gradlew run
